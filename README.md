# OpenX-Task2

1) All code is written in JavaScript.
2) All written functions are described by comments above them.
3) All tested functions are exported from app.cjs to app.test.js
4) Tests are implemented using JEST
5) To run tests install dependencies and run test using: npm test
6) The only problem encountered was calculating the greatest distance between users, but I used a mathematical formula that is described in the code.
